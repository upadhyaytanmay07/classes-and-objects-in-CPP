# Aim
To study and implement the concept of classes and objects in C++, including class definition, object creation, member functions, data members, and practical applications in various programming scenarios.

# Software Used
Compiler: GNU GCC (g++)

IDE: Visual Studio Code

Operating System: Windows/Linux

# Theory
# 1. Classes and Objects

In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties (data members) and behaviors (member functions) that the objects will have. An object is an instance of a class.

# 2. Access Specifiers
public: Members are accessible from outside the class

private: Members are accessible only within the class (default)

protected: Members are accessible within the class and by derived classes

# 3. Member Functions
Functions defined inside a class that operate on the object's data members. They can be defined inside or outside the class.

# 4. Constructors and Destructors
Special member functions for initializing objects and cleaning up resources when objects are destroyed.

    e. Call calc.division() to perform and display division
    
    4. End

# 4. Student details
Steps

    1. Start
    
    2. Define a Class Student
    
    a. Declare the following data members:
    
    b. name → string
    
    c. branch → string
    
    d. subject → string
    
    e. year → string (declared but not used in this code)
    
    f. result → float
